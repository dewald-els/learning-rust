> **Stack**: Last in, First out.
> Adding data: Pushed onto the stack.
> Removing data: Popping off the stack.
> Faster than adding to heap

> **Heap**: Less organised. 
> Adding data: 
> - Request amount of space. 
> - Memory allocator finds a spot that is big enough, returns a pointer/address of memory.
> Process is called Allocating on the heap.
> Pointer can be stored on the stack
